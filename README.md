# DimaBot

DimaBot is a feature-rich Twitch chat bot designed to enhance streams with a wide range of commands, moderation tools, and interactive features. It is highly customizable and integrates with various services to provide a seamless experience for both streamers and viewers.

The bot is powered by a Node.js backend and communicates with Twitch chat via TMI.js. It also includes a web server built with Express, which serves an API for the [domdimabot.com](https://domdimabot.com) website, where users can register and manage their bot settings.

## Features

-   **Command System:** A robust command system with a wide range of default commands and the ability to create custom commands.
-   **Moderation:** Tools to help moderate your channel, including adding/removing moderators and VIPs, banning users, and more.
-   **AI Integration:** Integration with Google Gemini to provide an AI-powered chat personality that can interact with users and perform moderation tasks.
-   **Interactive Commands:** Fun and interactive commands like duels, polls, predictions, and various "meters" (`amor`, `furrometro`, `sumimetro`).
-   **Song Requests:** Integration with Spotify for song requests.
-   **EventSub Support:** Handles Twitch EventSub notifications for events like follows, subscriptions, and raids.
-   **Web Dashboard:** A web-based dashboard (via `domdimabot.com`) for easy configuration and management.
-   **File Storage:** Uses AWS S3 for storing files related to triggers and other features.
-   **Caching:** Utilizes DragonflyDB (Redis-compatible) for caching to ensure fast response times.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
-   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
-   [DragonflyDB](https://www.dragonflydb.io/) or [Redis](https://redis.io/)
-   An AWS account with an S3 bucket
-   A Google Gemini API key

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/dimabot.git
    cd dimabot
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Configuration

The application is configured using environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following variables:

```env
# General

# Twitch Bot Account Credentials
TWITCH_USERNAME=your_bot_twitch_username
User_Token_Auth=oauth:your_twitch_oauth_token # Get from https://twitchapps.com/tmi/

# Database

DRAGONFLY_HOST=127.0.0.1

# AI (Google Gemini)
GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key

## Running the Application

The application consists of two main parts: the web server and the Twitch bot. You can run them in separate terminals.

-   **To run the web server:**
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

-   **To run the Twitch bot:**
    ```bash
    npm run bot
    ```

Both will run with `nodemon`, which will automatically restart the application when file changes are detected.
